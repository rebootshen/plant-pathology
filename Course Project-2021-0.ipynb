    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "For the course project, select one of the following competitions on Kaggle:\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Shopee - Price Match Guarantee](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching/):  Determine if two products are the same by their images\n",
    "\n",
    ">Do you scan online retailers in search of the best deals? You're joined by the many savvy shoppers who don't like paying extra for the same product depending on where they shop. Retail companies use a variety of methods to assure customers that their products are the cheapest. Among them is product matching, which allows a company to offer products at rates that are competitive to the same product sold by another retailer. To perform these matches automatically requires a thorough machine learning approach, which is where your data science skills could help.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Two different images of similar wares may represent the same product or two completely different items. Retailers want to avoid misrepresentations and other issues that could come from conflating two dissimilar products. Currently, a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning analyzes image and text information to compare similarity. But major differences in images, titles, and product descriptions prevent these methods from being entirely effective.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Shopee is the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Customers appreciate its easy, secure, and fast online shopping experience tailored to their region. The company also provides strong payment and logistical support along with a 'Lowest Price Guaranteed' feature on thousands of Shopee's listed products.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">In this competition, you’ll apply your machine learning skills to build a model that predicts which items are the same products.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The applications go far beyond Shopee or other retailers. Your contributions to product matching could support more accurate product categorization and uncover marketplace spam. Customers will benefit from more accurate listings of the same or similar products as they shop. Perhaps most importantly, this will aid you and your fellow shoppers in your hunt for the very best deals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Plant Pathology 2021 - FGVC8](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2021-fgvc8): Identify the category of foliar diseases in apple trees\n",
    "\n",
    ">Apples are one of the most important temperate fruit crops in the world. Foliar (leaf) diseases pose a major threat to the overall productivity and quality of apple orchards. The current process for disease diagnosis in apple orchards is based on manual scouting by humans, which is time-consuming and expensive.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Although computer vision-based models have shown promise for plant disease identification, there are some limitations that need to be addressed. Large variations in visual symptoms of a single disease across different apple cultivars, or new varieties that originated under cultivation, are major challenges for computer vision-based disease identification. These variations arise from differences in natural and image capturing environments, for example, leaf color and leaf morphology, the age of infected tissues, non-uniform image background, and different light illumination during imaging etc.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Plant Pathology 2020-FGVC7 challenge competition had a pilot dataset of 3,651 RGB images of foliar disease of apples. For Plant Pathology 2021-FGVC8, we have significantly increased the number of foliar disease images and added additional disease categories. This year’s dataset contains approximately 23,000 high-quality RGB images of apple foliar diseases, including a large expert-annotated disease dataset. This dataset reflects real field scenarios by representing non-homogeneous backgrounds of leaf images taken at different maturity stages and at different times of day under different focal camera settings.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">\n",
    ">The main objective of the competition is to develop machine learning-based models to accurately classify a given leaf image from the test dataset to a particular disease category, and to identify an individual disease from multiple disease symptoms on a single leaf image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Hotel-ID to Combat Human Trafficking 2021 - FGVC8](https://www.kaggle.com/c/hotel-id-2021-fgvc8/): Recognizing hotels to aid Human trafficking investigations\n",
    "\n",
    ">Victims of human trafficking are often photographed in hotel rooms as in the below examples. Identifying these hotels is vital to these trafficking investigations but poses particular challenges due to low quality of images and uncommon camera angles.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Even without victims in the images, hotel identification in general is a challenging fine-grained visual recognition task with a huge number of classes and potentially high intraclass and low interclass variation. In order to support research into this challenging task and create image search tools for human trafficking investigators, we created the TraffickCam mobile application, which allows every day travelers to submit photos of their hotel room. Read more about TraffickCam on TechCrunch.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">In this contest, competitors are tasked with identifying the hotel seen in test images from the TraffickCam dataset, which are based on a large gallery of training images with known hotel IDs.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Our team currently supports an image search system used at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in human trafficking investigations. Novel and interesting approaches have the potential to be incorporated in this search system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Groups\n",
    "Group projects should contain 2 students.  To sign up for a group, go to Canvas and under \"People\", join one of the existing \"Project Groups\".  _For group projects, the project report must state the percentage contribution from each project member._\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "You are free to choose the methodology to solve the task.  In machine learning, it is important to use domain knowledge to help solve the problem.  Hence, instead of blindly applying the algorithms to the data you need to think about how to represent the data in a way that makes sense for the algorithm to solve the task. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Kaggle Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "These 3 competitions have Kaggle Notebooks enabled, which provide free GPU/TPU computing resources (up to a limit).  You can develop your model in the Kaggle Notebook or on your own computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation on Kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "The final evaluation will be performed on Kaggle. Note that for these 3 competitions you need to submit your code via the Kaggle Notebook, which will then generate the submission file for processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each project group needs to give a presentation at the end of the semester.  You will record your presentation and upload it to FlipGrid.  The presentation is limited to 5 minutes.  You _must_ give a presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to hand in\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to turn in the following things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This ipynb file `CourseProject-2021.ipynb` with your source code and documentation. **You should write about all the various attempts that you make to find a good solution.** You may also submit .py files, but your documentation should be in the ipynb file.\n",
    "2. Your final submission file to Kaggle.\n",
    "3. A downloaded copy of your Kaggle Notebook that is submitted to Kaggle. This file should contain the code that generates the final submission file on Kaggle. This code will be used to verify that your Kaggle submission is reproducible.\n",
    "4. Presentation slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Files should be uploaded to \"Course Project\" on Canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "The marks of the assignment are distributed as follows:\n",
    "- 40% - Results using various feature representations, dimensionality reduction methods, classifiers, etc.\n",
    "- 25% - Trying out feature representations (e.g. adding additional features, combining features from different sources) or methods not used in the tutorials.\n",
    "- 15% - Quality of the written report.  More points for insightful observations and analysis.\n",
    "- 15% - Project presentation\n",
    "- 5% - Final ranking on the Kaggle test data (private leaderboard).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Late Penalty:** 25 marks will be subtracted for each day late.\n",
